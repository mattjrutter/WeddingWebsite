                            Both the ceremony and reception will be held inside the Shepherd of the Vally
                            church. So there will be no special clothing considerations needed since we'll be
                            protected from the wicked heat outside. Go ahead and look your best.

                            Grand Junction (GJ) does have an airport that connects through Denver, Salt Lake,
                            Dallas, and Phoenix. We usually find the flights that connect to GJ usually cost
                            about $80-$150 more as compared to just flying into Denver. If you fly in through
                            Denver and rent a car, then the drive from the Denver Airport to GJ is just a
                            little over 4 hours on I-70.

                            In terms of mid-tier hotels, we would recommend the rooms at the Comfort Inn on
                            Horizon Drive. There are other good hotels along Horizon Drive, like the Marriott,
                            Grand Vista Hotel, and La Quinta. Sorry, no discounts were made available.
