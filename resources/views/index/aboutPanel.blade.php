                <p>
                    Kaitlyn was born in Casper, WY and grew up there until moving to Fruita, CO before
                    her fifth-grade year. Kaitlyn graduated from Fruita Monument High School in 2012
                    and from there pursued higher education at Colorado Mesa University. In May 2017,
                    Kaitlyn graduated <em>magna cum laude</em> with her degree in chemistry and
                    biochemistry. Kaitlyn plans to further her education by pursuing a Ph.D. in
                    biochemistry this autumn. Her research goals entail exploring previously unknown
                    medical questions.

                    Kaitlyn and Matt first met at a birthday party after Matt separated from the Army.
                    After hanging out that next year through a mutual friend, they started to watch
                    Marvel movies together since Kaitlyn hadn't seen any thus far (<em>mostly because
                    she doesn't like action movies, but she wasn't going to tell him</em>). First date
                    was attending an old friend's wedding and another date included driving to the top
                    of the Bookcliffs to watch the stars (<em>nearly died</em>). Finally in September
                    of 2015, they made themselves officially "in a relationship."

                <p>
                    Matt was born in Toledo, OH and grew up there until moving to Fruita, CO for
                    his 5th grade through high school years. After high school, he joined the
                    US Army as a Cannon Crewmember which took him to Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA,
                    and a 9 month tour in Afghanistan. After separating from the Army, Matt is now
                    using his education benefits to pursue his dream of becoming a programmer (<em>
                    actually using his skills to build this website</em>) and plans to graduate from
                    CMU in May this year.
